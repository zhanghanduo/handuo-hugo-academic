Stereo Vision System on High Speed Unmanned Ground Vehicle<br/>
Purpose of this project to develop a stereo vision system to explore surroundings for obstacle detection, tracking and mapping; object classification; visual SLAM, road feature detection (like slope detection, curb detection and lane detection). <br/><br/>
