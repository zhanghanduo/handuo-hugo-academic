abstract = "Objective of multiple object tracking (MOT) is to assign a unique track identity for all the objects of interest in a video, across the whole sequence. Tracking-by-detection is the most common approach used in addressing MOT problem. In this work, we propose a method to address MOT by defining a dissimilarity measure based on object motion, appearance, structure, and size. We calculate the appearance and structure-based dissimilarity measure by matching histograms following a grid architecture. Motion and size for each track are predicted using the information from trackâ€™s history. These dissimilarity values are then used in the Hungarian algorithm, in the data association step for track identity assignment. In addition, we introduce a method to address any false detection  stable tracks. The proposed method runs in real time following an online approach. We evaluate our method in both MOT17 benchmark data-set for pedestrian tracking and KITTI benchmark data-set for vehicle tracking using the same system parameters to verify the robustness of the proposed method. The method can achieve state-of-the-art results in both benchmarks."
